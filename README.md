# PO-2015-problem-3
A solution for problem 3 in the programming olympiad 2015

When i participated in the PO i first solved the problem by "simulating" the acabus wich worked fine for low numbers of N, but took to long if N was to big.
In the final minutes of the competition i came up with a more mathematically based solution, but i didn't have the time to finish it.
Because i thought the problem was interesting i decided to solve it afterwards instead and to publish it here on GitHub.

Here's a simple paper describing the theory behind the solution
